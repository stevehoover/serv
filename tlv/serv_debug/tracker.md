# Conversion Notes

## Preparation Task
- Code is well-formed, single file with conditional compilation (`ifdef RISCV_FORMAL`)
- No modifications needed to prepared.sv
- Initial FEV verification passed successfully

## Assumptions
- RISCV_FORMAL sections will be preserved during conversion
- Clock and reset are standard (posedge i_clk, reset i_rst)

## Parameter Sets

The following parameter configurations are tested during FEV:

1. **Default**: W=1, RESET_PC=0 (fev_full.eqy)
2. **W=4**: Tests multi-bit width operation (fev_full_W_4.eqy) 
3. **RESET_PC=4096**: Tests different reset PC value (fev_full_RESET_PC_4096.eqy)

All parameter sets include both RISCV_FORMAL enabled and disabled paths via conditional compilation.

## Progress
- [x] Preparation task completed successfully
- [x] Signal Matching task completed successfully - added 89 internal signal matches
- [x] Parameters task completed successfully - created 2 additional parameter test configurations
- [x] Reset and Clock task completed successfully - added standard TL-Verilog clock and reset assignments
- [x] Name Generate Blocks task completed successfully - no generate blocks found
- [x] TLV File Format task completed successfully - code formatted with proper TLV header and structure
- [x] Naming Conventions task completed successfully - all signals renamed to TL-Verilog conventions, resolved SystemVerilog keyword conflicts
