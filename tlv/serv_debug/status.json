  "llm": "Simple Signals to Pipesignals task in progress. Successfully converted update_rd and dbg_rd to pipesignals with proper $$ prefix and bit ranges. Many more signals need conversion: update_* flags, dbg_* registers, xx1-xx31 registers, instruction decode flags, and pc register. Process is working correctly but requires systematic approach for the remaining ~50+ signals. The user pointed out that the use of `ifdef RISCV_FORMAL is not yet supported by the flow, so the conversion is put on hold."
