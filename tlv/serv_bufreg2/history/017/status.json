  "llm": "Successfully consolidated most of the SV-TLV interface. Created input pipesignals for all 13 module inputs and connected them at the top. Replaced Verilog signal usage in most logic with pipesignals. Added output connections for o_sh_done and o_dat. Remaining: o_op_b and o_q still use some *o_op_b references in logic due to circular dependency - o_op_b is both computed internally and used in the same expressions. All working changes pass FEV."
