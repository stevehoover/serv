  "llm": "âœ… SUCCESS: Properly restructured TLV macro following task guidelines. Moved $o_ibus_adr_next computation into serv_ctrl_logic macro and moved Verilog output assignments (*o_rd, *o_bad_pc) to module body after macro instantiation. Macro now contains pure logic, module handles interface connections. Structure follows TLV macro best practices."
