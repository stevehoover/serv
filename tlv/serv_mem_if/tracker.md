# Conversion Tracker

## Conversion Successfully Completed

All conversion tasks completed successfully with no issues.

## Code Size Impact

- **Original Verilog**: 53 lines (prepared.sv)
- **Final TL-Verilog**: 86 lines (wip.tlv) - 62% increase
- **TLV macro only**: ~30 lines (excluding interface and module wrapper)

The code size increase is due to:

1. **TLV macro structure**: Separation of logic from interface connections
2. **Enhanced comments**: Added explanatory comments for better readability  
3. **M5 support**: Added M5 preprocessing declarations
4. **SV-TLV interface**: Explicit input/output pipesignal connections

## FEV Coverage

- All FEV runs passed successfully across all parameter sets
- Key internal signals (`signbit`, `dat_valid`) properly matched
- Full FEV configurations provide comprehensive coverage

## Potential Future Optimizations

No functional optimizations were identified that could be implemented without changing behavior. The converted design maintains exact functional equivalence with the original.
