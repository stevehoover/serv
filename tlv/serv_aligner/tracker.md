# Conversion Tracker - serv_aligner

## Summary
**CONVERSION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - The serv_aligner module has been fully converted from Verilog to TL-Verilog with functional equivalence verified at each step by FEV.

## Code Assessment

### Original vs Converted
- **Original code**: 68 lines of SystemVerilog
- **Final TL-Verilog code**: 65 lines including TLV macro structure
- **Core TLV macro**: Only 15 lines of timing-abstract logic
- **Conversion impact**: Code became more modular and timing-abstract

### Structure Improvements
- Separated I/O interface handling from core logic using TLV macro
- Eliminated explicit clock/reset dependencies in core logic
- Enhanced reusability through macro structure
- Maintained all original comments and functionality

## Technical Details

### Assumptions Validated
- Design is flip-flop based with rising edge clock triggering ✓
- No clock gating or special clock enables present ✓  
- Reset is synchronous and positively asserted ✓
- No parameters or generate statements ✓

### Signal Conversions
- All internal signals converted to pipesignals with proper naming conventions
- Interface signals handled through clean SV-TLV boundary
- Registers converted to `<<1` timing-abstract assignments
- Conditional logic converted to ternary expressions

### Verification Status
- **FEV Status**: ✅ PASSED - All 15 conversion steps verified
- **Incremental FEV**: Passed at every refactoring step
- **Full FEV**: Final code verified equivalent to original prepared.sv
- **No unverified changes**: All modifications passed formal equivalence verification

## Final Assessment

### Strengths
- Complete functional equivalence maintained
- Clean timing-abstract TL-Verilog implementation
- Enhanced modularity through macro structure
- Preserved all original documentation and comments

### Areas for Future Enhancement
- Pipeline organization could be further optimized for specific timing requirements
- Additional when conditions could be added for fine-grained clock gating if needed
- Macro could be parameterized for different bus widths if variants are needed

## Issues/Concerns
**NONE** - No blocking issues, functional differences, or verification gaps identified.

## Recommendations
The conversion is production-ready. The resulting TL-Verilog code provides equivalent functionality to the original while offering enhanced timing abstraction and reusability through the macro structure.
