  "llm": "Successfully migrated ibus_cyc, init_done sequential logic, and misalign_trap_sync assignment. SandPiper now compiles with warnings about unused generate block signals. Counter generate blocks are complex due to parameter-dependent logic (W=1 vs W=4) requiring coordinated migration. Focus on completing remaining simple migrations before tackling the generate block counter system."
