  "llm": "Successfully completed counter system migration by connecting generate block signals to main counter logic. Added proper assignments for cnt_r, o_cnt_en, and out_cnt increment logic. Fixed misalign_trap_sync signal conflicts by removing redundant SV wire declaration. All parameter configurations now pass FEV successfully. Counter migration handles both W=1 and W=4 cases properly."
