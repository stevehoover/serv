  "llm": "Interface consolidation task is complex - the issue is structural differences between gold model (which has direct SV assigns using module ports) and gate model (which uses TLV pipesignals). The EQY analysis shows that output signals like o_rf_wreq, o_dbus_cyc etc. reference o_cnt_en in gold model but use pipesignals in gate model. This may require a different approach or the task may not be achievable without breaking equivalence. Need to reassess if this is the right approach or if there's a smaller incremental change to make."
