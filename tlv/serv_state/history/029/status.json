    "llm": "ðŸ”„ Migrate to TLV Expressions task in progress. Successfully migrated 2 TLV-style signals ($take_branch, $last_init) from \\SV_plus to \\TLV context. Learned that migration must be very incremental due to complex signal interdependencies and generate block scoping. Counter logic and complex register structures require careful handling. Need to continue with simple assign statements first before tackling more complex logic."
