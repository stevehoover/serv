Main changes: (1) Main always block - converted ibus_cyc, init_done, and o_ctrl_jump assignments to ternary with proper value retention, (2) Counter W=4 logic - converted if/else chain for cnt_en, (3) Counter W=1 reset logic - converted to ternary, (4) Unified counter logic - converted reset condition, (5) CSR logic - converted conditional assignment to ternary with value retention. Running FEV verification."
