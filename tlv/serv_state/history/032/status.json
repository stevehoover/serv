Successfully migrated 5 TLV-style signals ($take_branch, $last_init, $trap_pending, $misalign_trap_sync, *o_ctrl_trap) from \\SV_plus to \\TLV context. Fixed FEV configuration to match new TLV signal names. Incremental approach working well - need to continue with remaining simple assign statements before tackling complex counter logic and generate blocks."
