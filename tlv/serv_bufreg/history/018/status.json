  "llm": "Analyzed code for if/else and case statements. Found that all procedural if/else statements have already been converted to ternary expressions in previous tasks: 1) data[31:2] assignment uses ternary with i_en condition, 2) data[1:0] assignment uses nested ternary expressions, 3) lsb assignment combines i_en && i_cnt0 conditions in ternary, 4) data assignment uses ternary with i_en condition, 5) data_tail assignment uses ternary with i_en condition. No case statements found. All assignments already follow single-assignment semantics with proper value recirculation when not assigned. Task complete - all if/else converted to ternary."
