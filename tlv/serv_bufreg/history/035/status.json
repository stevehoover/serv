Issue found: replicated scope assignments use $$lsb and $$data_tail on RHS creating 'explicit assigned signal' errors. Need to handle feedback patterns in conditional assignments like '$$lsb <= condition ? new_value : $lsb' properly. Working on systematic conversion of generate block logic to TLV expressions."
