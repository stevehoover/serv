Successfully migrated extensive logic from \\SV_plus to \\TLV context: 1) clr_lsb assignment with ternary, 2) {cc, qq} concatenation with * prefixes, 3) All assign statements from generate for loops (lsb_w_eq_1, qq_w_eq_1, shift_amount, muxdata, muxout, lsb_w_eq_4, qq_w_eq_4), 4) Output assignments from generate if blocks using ternary expressions, 5) All simple output assignments (o_dbus_adr, o_ext_rs1), 6) clr_lsb_internal generate block logic migrated to TLV ternary with bit width handling, 7) Complete generate block infrastructure removal (generate/endgenerate), 8) Systematic * prefixes added to all input ports in always blocks. Remaining in \\SV_plus: always_ff blocks with cc_r (complex multi-assignment), data register logic (complex Verilog reg). All FEV configurations pass. Task completed with maximum achievable TLV migration scope."
