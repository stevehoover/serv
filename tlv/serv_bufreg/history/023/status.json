  "llm": "Successfully migrated several expressions from \\SV_plus to \\TLV context: 1) clr_lsb assignment, 2) {cc, qq} concatenation assignment with proper * prefixes for input ports, 3) output port assignments o_dbus_adr and o_ext_rs1. Remaining in \\SV_plus: always_ff block with cc_r (complex multi-assignment), generate blocks with internal logic (requires TLV scoping), and data register assignments (complex). Need to assess what else can be safely migrated vs. what should remain in \\SV_plus."
