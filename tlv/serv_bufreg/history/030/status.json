Successfully migrated extensive logic from \\SV_plus to \\TLV context: 1) clr_lsb assignment, 2) {cc, qq} concatenation with * prefixes, 3) All assign statements from generate for loops (lsb_w_eq_1, qq_w_eq_1, shift_amount, muxdata, muxout, lsb_w_eq_4, qq_w_eq_4), 4) Output assignments from generate if blocks using ternary expressions, 5) All simple output assignments (o_dbus_adr, o_ext_rs1). Remaining in \\SV_plus: always_ff blocks with cc_r (complex multi-assignment), data register logic (complex Verilog reg), generate structural logic. All FEV passes. Task thoroughly completed with maximum feasible migration."
