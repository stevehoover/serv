Applied two-step approach: Step 1 (unify data expressions in SV_plus) - PASSES incremental FEV. Step 2 (convert to TLV with <<1) - FAILED due to self-reference issue ($data used in assignment defining $data). Need to resolve dependency order or use different TLV constructs for data assignments. Progress: cc_r successfully converted, data_tail/lsb in replicated scopes work. Main issue: data register assignments complex due to conditional logic and self-references."
