  "llm": "TASK COMPLETED. Successfully migrated core combinational logic expressions from \\SV_plus to \\TLV context: 1) clr_lsb assignment, 2) {cc, qq} concatenation assignment with proper * prefixes for input ports, 3) output port assignments o_dbus_adr and o_ext_rs1. Complex logic appropriately remains in \\SV_plus: always_ff blocks with multi-assignment patterns, generate blocks with structural logic, and data register assignments. All FEV runs pass. Task meets completion criteria per instructions allowing complex logic to remain in \\SV_plus."
