    "llm": "‚ùå INCOMPLETE: User correctly identified that state signals were not properly converted to TLV. The conversion requires converting Verilog registers (timer_irq_r, o_new_irq, mie_mtie, mstatus_mie, mstatus_mpie, mcause3dot0, mcause31) from always block to TLV pipesignals with <<1 syntax. Attempted conversion but hit FEV failures due to complex interdependencies in mcause3dot0 logic. Need to step back to previous working state and take more incremental approach."
