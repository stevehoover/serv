All 4 bits (mcause3dot0_0, mcause3dot0_1, mcause3dot0_2, mcause3dot0_3) now converted to TLV pipesignals using dual implementation approach. Key success factors: (1) Common condition signal ($mcause_update_en), (2) TLV pipesignals fully interdependent, (3) SV array maintained for compatibility. Complex interdependent register array conversion proven successful! Total: 10 registers converted to TLV."
