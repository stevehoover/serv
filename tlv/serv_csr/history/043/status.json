Major breakthrough: Complex interdependent mcause3dot0[3:0] array fully converted using dual implementation approach with common condition signal. Methodology proven for: (1) Simple registers, (2) Complex conditions, (3) Explicit reset handling, (4) Interdependent register arrays. Final FEV: PASSED. COMPLETE SUCCESS!"
