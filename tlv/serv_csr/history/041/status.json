All 4 bits (mcause3dot0_0, mcause3dot0_1, mcause3dot0_2, mcause3dot0_3) now converted to TLV pipesignals using dual implementation approach with common condition signal ($mcause_update_en). This was the most complex register array conversion due to interdependencies. Major milestone achieved! Total: 10 registers fully converted to TLV."
